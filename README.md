<                      <p>The first reason is to provide a user with simple capabilities for uniquely and unambiguously identifying the data of interest (Parsons et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Parsons M, Duerr R, Minster JB (2010) Data citation and peer review.

Scientifically interesting data may have been processed and reprocessed many times using different algorithms for a variety of scientifically meaningful reasons. For example, simply stating that AVHRR Brightness Temperature data were used in a study does not provide enough information for another scientist to use the identical data set, much less identical files, in replicating the original study. The fact that there were multiple AVHRR instruments on multiple spacecraft, each with unique instrument characteristics, complicates the issue even further. In fact, since older versions of the data may be replaced by later versions, the actual data themselves have often been deleted due to space or cost concerns, although the need for identification and reference remains. There may be value to maintaining identifiers that resolve to metadata including provenance and context information for a data product used in scientific research even if the data is no longer available, although it may be that the scientific goal of being able to replicate original results is then impossible.</p><p>The second reason for having a unique identifier is to help users find and access the data regardless of where they currently reside or how the responsibility for managing the data has changed over time. Considering the resource requirements for data management, it may be necessary to transfer data between archives over time to ensure their preservation. If data identifiers are only unique within each archive or data center, then the identifiers at some archives could be the same as the identifiers assigned by other archives. However, to maximize the utility of the data, they still need to be discoverable and accessible to users regardless of how responsibility for the data migrates over time.</p><p>The third reason for having unique identifiers is to facilitate management of data over time. As technology evolves, so do the data management systems based on those technologies. As a result the identifier assigned to a particular data set could also change. Over time, the accumulation of such changes can become quite complex as the identifiers reflect the operating systems and applications used in each era. Moreover, the titles assigned to a data set may also morph over time. For example, a time series may be extended or as data from an additional suite of ground stations may be added to a compilation. Such changes make it difficult to ensure that a data set referenced decades ago is the same data set as one referenced today.</p><p>The fourth reason for having unique identifiers is to facilitate data citation in publications. Data citation serves at least two purposes. First, as mentioned earlier, the ability to precisely identify the data used in original research is fundamental to being able to reproduce research results and is therefore key to the scientific method. Second, as noted by the International Polar Year Data and Information Service (IPYDIS) “by encouraging proper citation of data sets, data providers and publishers receive appropriate credit for their efforts, the perception of data management as a discipline improves, and it is easier to track the use and impact of the data” (How to Cite a Dataset <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="How to Cite a Dataset (2008) international polar year data and information service. &#xA;                  http://ipydis.org/data/citations.html&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

In the earth sciences, reuse of data is relatively common. In simple reuse, the user copies the original data resulting in potentially many more copies of an object. Ideally, an identifier for the original data would also be copied in order to ensure traceability to the original data source. Such an identifier would need to be location independent. In other words, every copy of the object no matter where it was located would be identified by and potentially would contain that identifier. However, it is easy for data users to rearrange or reformat data, so that unique identifiers that assume no rearrangement or reformatting may not be sufficient for all scenarios. We defer discussion of this complication to the last use case.</p><p>For individual files, data producers often use filenames for identifiers. However, because these names are easily changed, this identifier approach appears less than ideal. Ideally, an identifier would be:

In the earth sciences, reuse of data is relatively common. In simple reuse, the user copies the original data resulting in potentially many more copies of an object. Ideally, an identifier for the original data would also be copied in order to ensure traceability to the original data source. Such an identifier would need to be location independent. In other words, every copy of the object no matter where it was located would be identified by and potentially would contain that identifier. However, it is easy for data users to rearrange or reformat data, so that unique identifiers that assume no rearrangement or reformatting may not be sufficient for all scenarios. We defer discussion of this complication to the last use case.</p><p>For individual files, data producers often use filenames for identifiers. However, because these names are easily changed, this identifier approach appears less than ideal. Ideally, an identifier would be:
1098c1093
<                         <p>Such an identifier could be used in databases or other catalog systems as the unique key for that object. Such identifiers should be difficult to change once established, suggesting that the producer should embed them within the data object. Given the importance of reproducibility and verifiability, such identifiers could have additional trust value beyond that of a simple identifier so they could be used as a part of a verification process. The fundamental operational concept for such an identifier is that it is <i>created once and never modified thereafter</i>.</p><p>Practically speaking, this implies that such an identifier needs to be globally unique yet creating one should not require any naming authority beyond that of the original data producer. The point being that any data producer anywhere, at any time, including an investigator working remotely in the field, should be able to generate an identifier for the data they are producing at that time.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec5">Unique locator</h3><p>If data, either individual files or collections of files, are to be useful for science they need to be discoverable. Given an identifier used at one time, it must be possible to find the same data at any later time. Yet, history has shown that custodianship of scientific data changes over time. For example, NASA Earth Science mission data typically starts at an investigator-led production facility, moves to an active archive, and should be archived at a designated permanent repository (NASA <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2006" title="NASA (2006) Requirements for archiving, distribution and user services in EOS Data and Information System (EOSDIS), 423-10-69 earth science data information system project.

Even permanent repositories have been known to move over time as the fortunes of their parent organizations rise and fall. Thus unlike the location independent identifiers ideally suited to the previous use case, identifiers used for this purpose must be location invariant, they point to an object; but are not necessarily located within or are a part of the object. Moreover, rather than pointing to just any or every copy of the object, they must point to the currently trusted source(s) for authentic copies of the data.</p><p>Sometimes data are reprocessed using later versions of algorithms or calibration that are intended to improve their quality. Commonly, older versions of the data are viewed as obsolete and are no longer recommended for future research. Since there is a cost to maintaining data, they may be deleted to make room in an archive for data that may be viewed as more valuable. Identifiers should still reference the old data, especially if they were used in published works. To preserve the ‘persistent’ quality of the ‘locator’ aspect of these identifiers, they should still be resolvable even if the data have been deleted. This resolution usually takes the form of a ‘landing page’ pointing out the fact that the data have been deleted, and directing the requestor to the version of the data that replaced the original one. Ideally, the reference should include metadata, which is typically much smaller than the data, and thus less of a burden for an archive to maintain. This metadata should include provenance and context information for the missing data, so that a determined investigator might be able to reproduce the missing data if fortune allows it.</p><p>Like the previous use case, these location invariant identifiers need to be globally unique. However, unlike the previous use case, external naming authorities beyond the original producer are not only necessary but also useful for dealing with data whose custody may move from one organization to another at some point in the future. Having an external naming authority minimizes the possibility that the dissolution of an archive or its parent organization will make it impossible to continue using existing identifiers when data transitions to a new repository. Also, to avoid generating identifiers that may be abandoned in the future, these identifiers should not be generated until an archival authority makes the decision to make the data permanently available. Lastly, the operational concept for these identifiers is that <i>once they are created, they will require ongoing maintenance into the future</i>.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec6">Citable locator</h3><p>While a complete discussion of data citation is beyond the scope of this paper, calls for researchers to cite the data used in their work are increasing. For example, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Council has recently asserted that data should “be credited and cited like the products of any other scientific activity” (AGU Council <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009" title="AGU Council (2009) The importance of long-term preservation and accessibility of geophysical data. &#xA;                  http://www.agu.org/sci_pol/positions/geodata.shtml&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

Consequently Earth science needs concise mechanisms to identify the data used in research, particularly identifiers that researchers can incorporate into a standard citation. Once incorporated into a publication, such an identifier should lead readers at any time in the future to the exact data used in the work that led to the publication.</p><p>Such identifiers are very similar to those in the previous use case. They should be location invariant, pointing to the currently accepted authoritative source(s) of the data and should be globally unique. Having an external name authority is an advantage in case the originating organization terminates operations, and ongoing maintenance can be expected once the identifier is created. However, such identifiers need to be broadly accepted and used by journal publishers and would ideally be the same type of identifier as publishers use themselves to identify articles and publications. In addition, it may not be practical to cite each and every one of the potentially hundreds of thousands or millions of files used in a particular research project, although such precise identification may be needed for verification of results. However, for providing credit to the data producers, such identifiers could facilitate identification of entire data sets. Identification of specific subsets of a larger data set may need further research.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec7">Scientifically unique identifier</h3><p>The fourth use case, which requires the ability to tell that two data instances contain the same information even if their formats are different, is somewhat different than the other three use cases. Dealing with this case requires more detailed consideration of the mechanisms under which information technology can modify the bit-for-bit representation of data while retaining its scientific equality. For example, conversion of integer values to floating point ones does not usually change their equivalence. Likewise, rearranging the array ordering, from row-major to column-major, does not affect the ability of a researcher to recognize the data in the rearranged format as identical with the original—as long as he or she knows about the mapping.

Once completed, these new materials will be submitted for an OASIS standard vote (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010b" title="Reed D (2010b) Personal communication with Ruth Duerr." href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR76" id="ref-link-section-d48958847e1585">2010b</a>).</p><p>XRIs were specifically developed to be independent of transport and access protocols, thereby allowing unambiguous assertions “that the same resource is being identified across different protocols, e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, XMPP” and in different contexts (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010a" title="Reed, D (2010a) Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Version 3.0, Working Draft 02. 18 January 2010. &#xA;                  http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/33876/xri-syntax-3.0-wd02.doc&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 11 January 2011" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR75" id="ref-link-section-d48958847e1591">2010a</a>). In addition, XRIs were designed to allow identifiers from multiple identifier schemes to be combined and shared; to allow delegation of naming authority for subsets of a namespace, to provide both human and machine readable identifiers, and to provide a mechanism for obtaining trusted responses on receipt of a XRI resolution request.</p><p>Since XRIs are being specifically developed to support resolution across multiple protocols, they could prove to be relatively impermeable to changes in technologies. Mechanisms for developing bindings for new protocols are well defined. As an example, Bartolomeo and Kovacikova describe the potential use of XRIs in combination with OMA’s XML Document Management specification to “enable interoperability of user profile data management between telecommunication and Internet services” (2009). Indeed, the largest extent XRI user community is a coalition of companies focused on Personal Data Exchange (PDE) technologies such as OpenId and Information Cards; while use in mobile bar code applications is another active area of work (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010b" title="Reed D (2010b) Personal communication with Ruth Duerr." href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR76" id="ref-link-section-d48958847e1597">2010b</a>). However, given the incomplete state of the specifications and previous W3C objection to it, the future of this identifier scheme is not clear.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27">User value</h4><p>XRIs have no more security issues than any other URI/URN-based scheme. The specification is too new to have been adopted by the publishing community; but it should be noted that http bound XRIs are fully qualified URLs, so could be used in a citation anywhere a URL can be used. The “XRI cross-reference syntax permits the inclusion of identifier metadata” (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010a" title="Reed, D (2010a) Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Version 3.0, Working Draft 02. 18 January 2010. &#xA;                  http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/33876/xri-syntax-3.0-wd02.doc&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 11 January 2011" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR75" id="ref-link-section-d48958847e1608">2010a</a>) that could provide additional trust value, such as encrypted or hashed values that can be verified. Whether the identifiers are opaque or have meaning is up to the naming authority.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28">Archive value</h4><p>Commercial name authorities exist for people and organizations—a small yearly fee is charged; but beyond that, communities are free to become their own authorities and evolve, as they deem necessary. Given the XRI cross-referencing capability, migrating data from one archive to another should be straightforward. It does not matter whether the resource is renamed during the process, a proper resolution service would find it under any identifier. Lastly, it should be noted that any kind of resource could be described by an XRI.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29">Use case support</h4><p>XRIs are location invariant not location independent and they do require a name authority. As such they do not meet the full requirements for a Unique Identifier (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#Sec66">Summary Discussion</a> section). However, like other URI-based identification schemes, XRIs would be acceptable Unique Locators.

After working with the W3C TAG to understand their issues, the XRI TC is developing a third version of the XRI syntax specification (Bartolomeo et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Bartolomeo G, Kovacikova T, Petersen F (2010) A novel approach to use data federation in next-generation networks.

Once completed, these new materials will be submitted for an OASIS standard vote (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010b" title="Reed D (2010b) Personal communication with Ruth Duerr." href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR76" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e1585">2010b</a>).</p><p>XRIs were specifically developed to be independent of transport and access protocols, thereby allowing unambiguous assertions “that the same resource is being identified across different protocols, e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, XMPP” and in different contexts (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010a" title="Reed, D (2010a) Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Version 3.0, Working Draft 02. 18 January 2010. &#xA;                  http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/33876/xri-syntax-3.0-wd02.doc&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 11 January 2011" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR75" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e1591">2010a</a>). In addition, XRIs were designed to allow identifiers from multiple identifier schemes to be combined and shared; to allow delegation of naming authority for subsets of a namespace, to provide both human and machine readable identifiers, and to provide a mechanism for obtaining trusted responses on receipt of a XRI resolution request.</p><p>Since XRIs are being specifically developed to support resolution across multiple protocols, they could prove to be relatively impermeable to changes in technologies. Mechanisms for developing bindings for new protocols are well defined. As an example, Bartolomeo and Kovacikova describe the potential use of XRIs in combination with OMA’s XML Document Management specification to “enable interoperability of user profile data management between telecommunication and Internet services” (2009). Indeed, the largest extent XRI user community is a coalition of companies focused on Personal Data Exchange (PDE) technologies such as OpenId and Information Cards; while use in mobile bar code applications is another active area of work (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010b" title="Reed D (2010b) Personal communication with Ruth Duerr." href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR76" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e1597">2010b</a>). However, given the incomplete state of the specifications and previous W3C objection to it, the future of this identifier scheme is not clear.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec27">User value</h4><p>XRIs have no more security issues than any other URI/URN-based scheme. The specification is too new to have been adopted by the publishing community; but it should be noted that http bound XRIs are fully qualified URLs, so could be used in a citation anywhere a URL can be used. The “XRI cross-reference syntax permits the inclusion of identifier metadata” (Reed <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010a" title="Reed, D (2010a) Extensible Resource Identifier (XRI) Version 3.0, Working Draft 02. 18 January 2010. &#xA;                  http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/33876/xri-syntax-3.0-wd02.doc&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 11 January 2011" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR75" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e1608">2010a</a>) that could provide additional trust value, such as encrypted or hashed values that can be verified. Whether the identifiers are opaque or have meaning is up to the naming authority.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec28">Archive value</h4><p>Commercial name authorities exist for people and organizations—a small yearly fee is charged; but beyond that, communities are free to become their own authorities and evolve, as they deem necessary. Given the XRI cross-referencing capability, migrating data from one archive to another should be straightforward. It does not matter whether the resource is renamed during the process, a proper resolution service would find it under any identifier. Lastly, it should be noted that any kind of resource could be described by an XRI.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec29">Use case support</h4><p>XRIs are location invariant not location independent and they do require a name authority. As such they do not meet the full requirements for a Unique Identifier (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#Sec66">Summary Discussion</a> section). However, like other URI-based identification schemes, XRIs would be acceptable Unique Locators. While they do not have wide-spread acceptance of the publishing community, so are not optimal as a Citable Locators, they do have an advantage over DOIs for individual items within a data set in that there are no per item charges. XRIs in and of themselves do not make it possible to verify whether or not the contents of a data file or data set are unchanged under format transformations or content rearrangement, so are unusable as Scientifically Unique Identifiers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec30">The Handle System</h3><p>Invented by the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI), the Handle System facilitates the assignment and management of unique global persistent identifiers to locate digital resources over time, in a manner that is independent of current or future storage locations (Corporation for National Research Initiatives <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2009a" title="Corporation for National Research Initiatives (2009) The handle system. &#xA;                  http://www.handle.net/&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

Any organization can establish itself as an LHS and serve as its own naming authority by registering with the GHR and installing a Handle Server to assign and maintain unique identifiers for resources. Sustainability of the Handle System is fostered by a business model that requires a one-time registration fee, which CNRI charges for assigning a prefix to an organization, and an annual maintenance fee for the GHS to point to the LHS (Corporation for National Research Initiatives <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007b" title="Corporation for National Research Initiatives (2007b) Handle system service agreement (Version 3). &#xA;                  http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5029&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

An installed Handle Server includes administrative tools that can be used either on site or remotely to manage the Handle Server and to maintain the Handles that it assigns. These tools can be used to change the location of a resource without occurring charges, if used by a naming authority responsible for the archive (Corporation for National Research Initiatives <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007a" title="Corporation for National Research Initiatives (2007a) HANDLE.NET (version 6.2) technical manual (Version 2). &#xA;                  http://hdl.handle.net/4263537/5031&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

An Alpha version of this extension to the PURL system is expected.</p><p>No security issues are known, beyond those endemic with any URL-based system. Given the exhibited durability of the system, its close ties to IETF and the W3C, and its current evolution to better support the Semantic Web it is likely that PURLs will remain viable for quite some time.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec51">User value</h4><p>The name portion of the PURL can be either opaque or meaningful as desired by the user, and is compatible with many other naming conventions. Since PURLs are simply URLs, they can be used in a citation in any place where a URL can be used. PURLs, in and of themselves, are not known to have any additional trust value. However, it is possible to choose a scheme for assigning the name portion of the PURL that does have additional trust value, for example a scheme based off a hash of the data itself.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec52">Archive value</h4><p>The PURL and PURLz systems are open source and freely available, and the PURL user community appears to be fairly active. The current OCLC-based system is free of charge. In 2007, OCLC and Zepheira announced that they would work together to re-architect OCLC’s PURL services “to more effectively support the management of a ‘Web of data’” (Online Computer Library Center <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Online Computer Library Center (2007) OCLC to work with Zepheira to redesign OCLC’s PURL service. &#xA;                  http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200669.htm&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

In addition to enhancements to reflect current W3C standards, the updated version of PURLs allows for the extension to objects other than web resources that are important to the Semantic Web. In particular the updated PURL services can handle links to resources such as people, organizations, concepts, and scientific data.</p><p>Like any URL-based identifier scheme, persistence depends on maintenance and the commitment of the provider. Given proper attention to future flexibility considerations, migration of data from one archive to another, or from place to place within an archive is easily managed. In particular, PURL reliance on partial resolution allows a great deal of flexibility at all scales from moving individual files, entire data sets, or an entire archive.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec53">Use case support</h4><p>Like other URI-based identification schemes, PURLs are location invariant not location independent and they do require a name authority. As such they do not meet the full requirements for a Unique Identifier (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#Sec66">Summary Discussion</a> section). However, like the other URI-based identification schemes, PURLs would be acceptable Unique Locators. While they do not have the wide-spread acceptance of the publishing community, so are not optimal as a Citable Locator for data sets as a whole, they do have an advantage over DOIs for individual items within a data set in that there are no per item charges. PURLs in and of themselves do not make it possible to verify whether or not the contents of a data file or data set are unchanged under format transformations or content rearrangement, so are unusable as Scientifically Unique Identifiers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec54">Uniform resource identifier/name/locator</h3><p>A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a naming and addressing technology that uses “a compact sequence of characters to identify” World Wide Web resources (Berners-Lee et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Berners-Lee T, Fielding R, Masinter L (2005) Uniform Resource Identifier (URI).

In general, URLs, URNs, and IRIs could all be used to uniquely identify data collections.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55">Naming syntax</h4><p>The syntax of these kinds of identifiers is familiar from their common use.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec56">Technical value</h4><p>The Network Working Group at the IETF maintains the URI specifications. URI technologies are used in domain name systems and in systems that enable email and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p><p>URLs use domain names to locate resources. Domain names have a well-defined naming structure. The Domains can be categorized as generic top-level domains (.com, .org), country code domains (.us, .fr), and second level or lower domains. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is in charge of managing the root Domain Name System (DNS). ICANN delegates the top domain names to the Network Information Center (NIC). Each country manages their country code level domains.</p><p>URNs do not imply availability of the resource being identified. The IANA is in charge of processing applications for URNs. Usually only the URN scheme is registered, not the actual identifiers. Since there is no universal registry for URNs, it is difficult to use them or resolve them.</p><p>The common belief about the difference between URNs and URLs is that a URL should be resolvable, while a URN does not have to be. This may be due in part to the fact that according to their designers, URNs “are intended to serve as persistent, location-independent resource identifiers” (Moats <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Moats R (1997) URN syntax.

This also implies to many that a URN is more persistent, since it is not dependent on a web domain that can change or disappear over time.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec57">User value</h4><p>For many purposes, the use of URLs is preferred to URNs, since even though both provide identifier mechanisms, URLs provide easy navigation to the resource being identified, letting programs and users obtain information in a transparent way. In addition, the use of URNs does not guarantee persistence nor determine all ownership issues, although it can be argued that, given the relatively complex steps required to obtain and manage a URN, organizations that do so are likely to be more stable. At the same time, URLs clearly suffer from greater transience overall, and their use in situations that do not provide URI resolution will likewise cause frustration, as users enter a URL into their browser and get a “404: resource not found” message. So neither mechanism provides a guarantee of the existence or discoverability of an object.</p><p>While plain URLs are not necessarily persistent, they are accepted as a part of a citation by many journals. While the URL/URN/URI schemes are likely to be around for a very long time, given their ubiquitous use internationally, individual URL or URN values have no particular trust value. URLs in particular, are known for their impermanence. URI-based naming schemes can either be opaque or transparent depending on the needs of the designer.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec58">Archive value</h4><p>An organization that chooses to use URIs as its identifiers will need to maintain the web domain, manage the structure of the URIs and maintain the URL redirects (Cox et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Cox S, Schade S, Bermudez LE, Simonis I (2010) “OGC identifier policy—a case for http URI”, Open Geospatial Consortium, Document No.: 10-124r1" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d48958847e2472">2010</a>) for the long-term. For example, the Open Geospatial Consortium currently uses URLs to uniquely identify standards, types of documents, coordinate reference systems, etc. The OGC Naming Authority Board is in charge of creating and approving each identifier and its resolutions. Identifiers could reference documents, images, electronic mailboxes, files, or other digital resources. In the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Berners-Lee T, Hendler J, Lassila O (2001) The semantic web.

For example, if an original URL contains information that identifies or brands an item as belonging to some physical organization, the odds of the next archive being willing to maintain that original URL becomes very small. In addition, while redirection can take the user to the correct object, a bookmark created from the original landing page will not persist.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec59">Use case support</h4><p>URNs were designed to be location independent. As such they would meet the requirements for Unique Identifiers. However, using URNs as Unique Identifiers for Earth Science data, would require designing a naming scheme and applying to IANA for approval, unless one of the existing approved URN identifier schemes were adopted. Since they would not be location invariant they would neither make an acceptable Unique Locator nor Citable Locator. On the other hand, URLs are not location independent, so do not fulfill the requirements of a Unique Identifier; but are location invariant so could conceivably act as a Unique Locator. Using them as such however, requires a long-term commitment by the archive and is problematic at best in the case where the data moves from one archive to another. While URLs are widely used within citations, their general impermanence makes them suboptimal as Citable Locators. Neither URNs nor URLs, in and of themselves, make it possible to verify whether or not the contents of a data file or data set are unchanged under format transformations or content rearrangement, so neither are unusable as Scientifically Unique Identifiers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec60">Universally unique identifier</h3><p>A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a number that is 16-bytes (128-bits), as specified by the Open Software Foundation’s Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) standard (Kong <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Kong MM (1995) DCE: an environment for secure client/server computing—Open Software Foundation’s Distributed Computing Environment—Technology Information.

Announcing the existence of a valid IP address is considered to be a security risk. Later versions of the UUID standard do not contain the MAC address, relying on random number generators or a hashing scheme instead (Leach et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Leach P, Mealling M, Salz R (2005) A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URN namespace.

Version information is included within 4 of the 128 bits available.</p><p>A common usage of UUIDs is as a unique label that can be associated with a less unique identifier, for example as a database primary key associated with a filename. In this limited context UUIDs are compatible with other identification schemes. Because UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform Resource Names; however, some other scheme is required to form a URL, so UUIDs have limited use in discovering or accessing the item named (Leach et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Leach P, Mealling M, Salz R (2005) A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URN namespace.

While it is not guaranteed that a UUID will be unique across all domains, it is highly unlikely that two identical UUIDs will be created. The UUID is designed to be opaque—information contained in them is not meant to be human readable. UUIDs have additional trust value when one of the hashing schemes is used when minting them. In these cases, users may re-hash the data to verify that no changes have been made since the UUID was minted.

Since PURLs are simply URLs, they can be used in a citation in any place where a URL can be used. PURLs, in and of themselves, are not known to have any additional trust value. However, it is possible to choose a scheme for assigning the name portion of the PURL that does have additional trust value, for example a scheme based off a hash of the data itself.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec52">Archive value</h4><p>The PURL and PURLz systems are open source and freely available, and the PURL user community appears to be fairly active. The current OCLC-based system is free of charge. In 2007, OCLC and Zepheira announced that they would work together to re-architect OCLC’s PURL services “to more effectively support the management of a ‘Web of data’” (Online Computer Library Center <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2007" title="Online Computer Library Center (2007) OCLC to work with Zepheira to redesign OCLC’s PURL service. &#xA;                  http://www.oclc.org/news/releases/200669.htm&#xA;                  &#xA;                .

In addition to enhancements to reflect current W3C standards, the updated version of PURLs allows for the extension to objects other than web resources that are important to the Semantic Web. In particular the updated PURL services can handle links to resources such as people, organizations, concepts, and scientific data.</p><p>Like any URL-based identifier scheme, persistence depends on maintenance and the commitment of the provider. Given proper attention to future flexibility considerations, migration of data from one archive to another, or from place to place within an archive is easily managed. In particular, PURL reliance on partial resolution allows a great deal of flexibility at all scales from moving individual files, entire data sets, or an entire archive.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec53">Use case support</h4><p>Like other URI-based identification schemes, PURLs are location invariant not location independent and they do require a name authority. As such they do not meet the full requirements for a Unique Identifier (see <a data-track="click" data-track-label="link" data-track-action="section anchor" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#Sec66">Summary Discussion</a> section). However, like the other URI-based identification schemes, PURLs would be acceptable Unique Locators. While they do not have the wide-spread acceptance of the publishing community, so are not optimal as a Citable Locator for data sets as a whole, they do have an advantage over DOIs for individual items within a data set in that there are no per item charges.

In general, URLs, URNs, and IRIs could all be used to uniquely identify data collections.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec55">Naming syntax</h4><p>The syntax of these kinds of identifiers is familiar from their common use.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec56">Technical value</h4><p>The Network Working Group at the IETF maintains the URI specifications. URI technologies are used in domain name systems and in systems that enable email and File Transfer Protocol (FTP).</p><p>URLs use domain names to locate resources. Domain names have a well-defined naming structure. The Domains can be categorized as generic top-level domains (.com, .org), country code domains (.us, .fr), and second level or lower domains. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) is in charge of managing the root Domain Name System (DNS). ICANN delegates the top domain names to the Network Information Center (NIC). Each country manages their country code level domains.</p><p>URNs do not imply availability of the resource being identified. The IANA is in charge of processing applications for URNs. Usually only the URN scheme is registered, not the actual identifiers. Since there is no universal registry for URNs, it is difficult to use them or resolve them.</p><p>The common belief about the difference between URNs and URLs is that a URL should be resolvable, while a URN does not have to be. This may be due in part to the fact that according to their designers, URNs “are intended to serve as persistent, location-independent resource identifiers” (Moats <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1997" title="Moats R (1997) URN syntax.

This also implies to many that a URN is more persistent, since it is not dependent on a web domain that can change or disappear over time.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec57">User value</h4><p>For many purposes, the use of URLs is preferred to URNs, since even though both provide identifier mechanisms, URLs provide easy navigation to the resource being identified, letting programs and users obtain information in a transparent way. In addition, the use of URNs does not guarantee persistence nor determine all ownership issues, although it can be argued that, given the relatively complex steps required to obtain and manage a URN, organizations that do so are likely to be more stable. At the same time, URLs clearly suffer from greater transience overall, and their use in situations that do not provide URI resolution will likewise cause frustration, as users enter a URL into their browser and get a “404: resource not found” message. So neither mechanism provides a guarantee of the existence or discoverability of an object.</p><p>While plain URLs are not necessarily persistent, they are accepted as a part of a citation by many journals. While the URL/URN/URI schemes are likely to be around for a very long time, given their ubiquitous use internationally, individual URL or URN values have no particular trust value. URLs in particular, are known for their impermanence. URI-based naming schemes can either be opaque or transparent depending on the needs of the designer.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec58">Archive value</h4><p>An organization that chooses to use URIs as its identifiers will need to maintain the web domain, manage the structure of the URIs and maintain the URL redirects (Cox et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Cox S, Schade S, Bermudez LE, Simonis I (2010) “OGC identifier policy—a case for http URI”, Open Geospatial Consortium, Document No.: 10-124r1" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR21" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e2472">2010</a>) for the long-term. For example, the Open Geospatial Consortium currently uses URLs to uniquely identify standards, types of documents, coordinate reference systems, etc. The OGC Naming Authority Board is in charge of creating and approving each identifier and its resolutions. Identifiers could reference documents, images, electronic mailboxes, files, or other digital resources. In the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2001" title="Berners-Lee T, Hendler J, Lassila O (2001) The semantic web.

For example, if an original URL contains information that identifies or brands an item as belonging to some physical organization, the odds of the next archive being willing to maintain that original URL becomes very small. In addition, while redirection can take the user to the correct object, a bookmark created from the original landing page will not persist.</p><h4 class="c-article__sub-heading c-article__sub-heading--small" id="Sec59">Use case support</h4><p>URNs were designed to be location independent. As such they would meet the requirements for Unique Identifiers. However, using URNs as Unique Identifiers for Earth Science data, would require designing a naming scheme and applying to IANA for approval, unless one of the existing approved URN identifier schemes were adopted. Since they would not be location invariant they would neither make an acceptable Unique Locator nor Citable Locator. On the other hand, URLs are not location independent, so do not fulfill the requirements of a Unique Identifier; but are location invariant so could conceivably act as a Unique Locator. Using them as such however, requires a long-term commitment by the archive and is problematic at best in the case where the data moves from one archive to another. While URLs are widely used within citations, their general impermanence makes them suboptimal as Citable Locators. Neither URNs nor URLs, in and of themselves, make it possible to verify whether or not the contents of a data file or data set are unchanged under format transformations or content rearrangement, so neither are unusable as Scientifically Unique Identifiers.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec60">Universally unique identifier</h3><p>A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) is a number that is 16-bytes (128-bits), as specified by the Open Software Foundation’s Distributed Computing Environment (DCE) standard (Kong <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 1995" title="Kong MM (1995) DCE: an environment for secure client/server computing—Open Software Foundation’s Distributed Computing Environment—Technology Information.

Version information is included within 4 of the 128 bits available.</p><p>A common usage of UUIDs is as a unique label that can be associated with a less unique identifier, for example as a database primary key associated with a filename. In this limited context UUIDs are compatible with other identification schemes. Because UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform Resource Names; however, some other scheme is required to form a URL, so UUIDs have limited use in discovering or accessing the item named (Leach et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2005" title="Leach P, Mealling M, Salz R (2005) A Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) URN namespace.

While it is not guaranteed that a UUID will be unique across all domains, it is highly unlikely that two identical UUIDs will be created.

While the simplicity of such a table can be convenient, a discussion of the issues of each use case is necessary to address the complexity and potential use of these identifier schemes. In the following sections, we address the results of the assessment in terms of the use cases defined above for both data sets and individual data files or granules.

<                      <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec67">Unique identifier</h3><p>Of all of the identifier schemes assessed, the one that most closely meets all of the requirements for a Unique Identifier is the UUID scheme. UUIDs are globally unique and do not require a naming authority. Specific versions of the generation algorithm can be used to encode additional trust information such as a message digest. Software to generate UUIDs is readily available, so it should be possible to create them as needed from virtually anywhere in the world. UUIDs are used as unique keys in catalogs and within metadata records and can be used within the objects themselves. While UUIDs would work well at both a data set and a data file level, UUIDs are particularly suited to identification of individual objects.</p><p>Beyond UUIDs, any of the URL or URI-based schemes could be used if the requirement that there be no central name authority is relaxed and/or if some scheme to guarantee the global uniqueness of the name is in place. Indeed, it is common in some disciplines to combine a Unique Identifier with a Unique Locator to create a single identifier that satisfies both use cases. For example, in the Life Sciences the ZooBank uses UUID’s for the Object ID portion of their LSIDs (Pyle and Michel <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Pyle R, Michel E (2008) ZooBank: developing a nomenclatural tool for unifying 250 years of biological information.

However, it is not clear that the need for ongoing maintenance of the combined identifier as the data moves through its lifecycle from the research community into an archive or archives outweighs the benefits of this path, though clearly the level of maintenance required would be considerably less for collections of objects, than for individual objects.</p><p>It should also be noted that globally unique identifiers can be generated by investigators using any of the URI-based schemes, provided of course that the investigator has pre-reserved a namespace with a provider. Of course, the risk with this approach is the creation of large numbers of what appear to be Unique Locators (e.g., Handles, DOIs, PURLs, ARKs, etc.) that are not actually resolvable. This can occur for a variety of reasons, for example early in the research process data is not generally accessible though it may be shared within a research group or with collaborators at other institutes, or later in the data lifecycle when an investigator/archive determines that only certain versions or portions of the data should be published or archived. At this point it is not clear how large numbers of non-resolvable identifiers will impact the longevity of a Unique Locator technology, though the value of that technology can be expected to decrease in the eyes of the user community.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec68">Unique locator</h3><p>Any of the URL/URI/IRI-based identifier schemes assessed could be used here and since there are currently no strong market leaders to help make the choice among them, the decision must be based on secondary criteria. Of the suite of schemes available, ARKs perhaps provide the most additional trust value due to explicit statements that are included in the metadata about the preservation commitments of the provider, while XRIs perhaps provide the most protection against future technologic change since they were designed to be independent of transport and access protocols. The Handle system has perhaps the largest user base, which could be taken as a demonstration of its expected longevity, though the PURL claim to support by OCLC, IETF, and W3C is perhaps a potent counter argument. Of the suite, DOIs, at least at the individual file level, are perhaps the most problematic given that the current per DOI financial charges which, while small on a per item basis, quickly mount up when the number of objects is very large as it often is in the Earth sciences. Lastly, while local URL schemes can fit the bill in the short term, in the long term they provide the additional risk that in the event that data must move to a new repository, that new repository will be reluctant or unable to continue supporting the existing local URL scheme. In all cases, it is unwise to place organizational names within these identifiers, since should data move to a new repository it is very unlikely that they would be willing to continue maintaining identifiers containing some other organization’s name (Willet <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Willet P (2010) NOID: Nice Opaque Identifier (Minter and Name Resolver), &#xA;                  https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/NOID&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 15 September 2010" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR100" id="ref-link-section-d48958847e2634">2010</a>).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec69">Citable locator</h3><p>While most publications now allow the use of URLs in citations, so that all of the URL/URI/IRI based identification schemes discussed in this paper could potentially be used as a Citable Locator, DOIs are the identification scheme currently adopted by most commercial publishers in the Earth sciences. Open access publishers, such as ARIADNE have adopted the Handle System to generate persistent identifiers, which also are UUID-compliant, for learning objects published (Klerkx et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Klerkx J, Vandeputte B, Parra G, Santos JL, Van Assche F, Duval E (2010) How to share and reuse learning resources: the ARIADNE experience.

While DataCite does support other identifiers, DOIs are the data set identification scheme primarily supported by DataCite, an international consortium of libraries and information centers whose vision is “to support researchers by providing methods for them to locate, identify, and cite research datasets with confidence” (DataCite). When the intent of a citation is to provide credit to the data producer, so that a citation of a data collection as an entity is appropriate, the modest per DOI charges are not a stumbling block for well-funded data repositories at the data set level.

>                      <h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec67">Unique identifier</h3><p>Of all of the identifier schemes assessed, the one that most closely meets all of the requirements for a Unique Identifier is the UUID scheme. UUIDs are globally unique and do not require a naming authority. Specific versions of the generation algorithm can be used to encode additional trust information such as a message digest. Software to generate UUIDs is readily available, so it should be possible to create them as needed from virtually anywhere in the world. UUIDs are used as unique keys in catalogs and within metadata records and can be used within the objects themselves. While UUIDs would work well at both a data set and a data file level, UUIDs are particularly suited to identification of individual objects.</p><p>Beyond UUIDs, any of the URL or URI-based schemes could be used if the requirement that there be no central name authority is relaxed and/or if some scheme to guarantee the global uniqueness of the name is in place. Indeed, it is common in some disciplines to combine a Unique Identifier with a Unique Locator to create a single identifier that satisfies both use cases. For example, in the Life Sciences the ZooBank uses UUID’s for the Object ID portion of their LSIDs (Pyle and Michel <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2008" title="Pyle R, Michel E (2008) ZooBank: developing a nomenclatural tool for unifying 250 years of biological information. Zootaxa, 1950, 39–50. &#xA;                  http://www.azoresbioportal.angra.uac.pt/files/publicacoes_Pyle%20et%20al_2009_Zootaxa.pdf&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 16 March 2011" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR74" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e2617">2008</a>).</p><p>Relaxing the requirement that there be no central name authority may seem like a reasonable option for data centers and large research groups that have the means to either become a name authority or to develop relationships with an external authority, especially since the data these group generate is not likely to be acquired and identified in the field, though this is a less viable option for individual investigators or small research teams. However, it is not clear that the need for ongoing maintenance of the combined identifier as the data moves through its lifecycle from the research community into an archive or archives outweighs the benefits of this path, though clearly the level of maintenance required would be considerably less for collections of objects, than for individual objects.</p><p>It should also be noted that globally unique identifiers can be generated by investigators using any of the URI-based schemes, provided of course that the investigator has pre-reserved a namespace with a provider. Of course, the risk with this approach is the creation of large numbers of what appear to be Unique Locators (e.g., Handles, DOIs, PURLs, ARKs, etc.) that are not actually resolvable. This can occur for a variety of reasons, for example early in the research process data is not generally accessible though it may be shared within a research group or with collaborators at other institutes, or later in the data lifecycle when an investigator/archive determines that only certain versions or portions of the data should be published or archived. At this point it is not clear how large numbers of non-resolvable identifiers will impact the longevity of a Unique Locator technology, though the value of that technology can be expected to decrease in the eyes of the user community.</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec68">Unique locator</h3><p>Any of the URL/URI/IRI-based identifier schemes assessed could be used here and since there are currently no strong market leaders to help make the choice among them, the decision must be based on secondary criteria. Of the suite of schemes available, ARKs perhaps provide the most additional trust value due to explicit statements that are included in the metadata about the preservation commitments of the provider, while XRIs perhaps provide the most protection against future technologic change since they were designed to be independent of transport and access protocols. The Handle system has perhaps the largest user base, which could be taken as a demonstration of its expected longevity, though the PURL claim to support by OCLC, IETF, and W3C is perhaps a potent counter argument. Of the suite, DOIs, at least at the individual file level, are perhaps the most problematic given that the current per DOI financial charges which, while small on a per item basis, quickly mount up when the number of objects is very large as it often is in the Earth sciences. Lastly, while local URL schemes can fit the bill in the short term, in the long term they provide the additional risk that in the event that data must move to a new repository, that new repository will be reluctant or unable to continue supporting the existing local URL scheme. In all cases, it is unwise to place organizational names within these identifiers, since should data move to a new repository it is very unlikely that they would be willing to continue maintaining identifiers containing some other organization’s name (Willet <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Willet P (2010) NOID: Nice Opaque Identifier (Minter and Name Resolver), &#xA;                  https://confluence.ucop.edu/display/Curation/NOID&#xA;                  &#xA;                 Accessed 15 September 2010" href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR100" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e2634">2010</a>).</p><h3 class="c-article__sub-heading" id="Sec69">Citable locator</h3><p>While most publications now allow the use of URLs in citations, so that all of the URL/URI/IRI based identification schemes discussed in this paper could potentially be used as a Citable Locator, DOIs are the identification scheme currently adopted by most commercial publishers in the Earth sciences. Open access publishers, such as ARIADNE have adopted the Handle System to generate persistent identifiers, which also are UUID-compliant, for learning objects published (Klerkx et al. <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2010" title="Klerkx J, Vandeputte B, Parra G, Santos JL, Van Assche F, Duval E (2010) How to share and reuse learning resources: the ARIADNE experience. Sustaining TEL: from innovation to learning and practice. Lect Notes Comput Sci 6383/2010:183–196. doi:&#xA;                  10.1007/978-3-642-16020-2_13&#xA;                  &#xA;                &#xA;                        " href="/article/10.1007/s12145-011-0083-6#ref-CR41" id="ref-link-section-d47753070e2645">2010</a>). While DataCite does support other identifiers, DOIs are the data set identification scheme primarily supported by DataCite, an international consortium of libraries and information centers whose vision is “to support researchers by providing methods for them to locate, identify, and cite research datasets with confidence” (DataCite). When the intent of a citation is to provide credit to the data producer, so that a citation of a data collection as an entity is appropriate, the modest per DOI charges are not a stumbling block for well-funded data repositories at the data set level. Less-funded repositories could use Handles, ARKs, and PURLs, etc. When the costs of DOIs have been relaxed, “one can easily imagine supporting some collections using handles and some collections using DOIs” (Crosas <a data-track="click" data-track-action="reference anchor" data-track-label="link" data-test="citation-ref" aria-label="Reference 2011" title="Crosas M (2011) The dataverse network®: an open-source application for sharing, discovering and preserving data.
